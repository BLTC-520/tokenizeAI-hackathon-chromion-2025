Problem to be solved:
- If user choose "cancel" while token creation, will error, haven't build on this
- Profile page need to change, the whole UI is not so inituative 
- Is token creation by the agentic mode need the private key? tryout other wallet
- Give a placeholder "I want to earn $2000 next week, elizaOS try do action based on this" OR after the token suggestion, hit"Confirm" -> means "User wants to create `${token1 with params} and  `${token2 with params}` passed to elizaOS to make the token creation work, then user can directly see at the marketplace

- Implement ElizaOS might outside of the project and use routing/api to link them together, just build a websocket seeing 2 agents speaking, like the agent have a name and have a character, he is in charge of thinking based on the skill of the user, what could the user create and the price of the token. -> passed back to frontend.
